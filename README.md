## About Me
Hi there! I'm MattÃ©o, a tech enthusiast with a deep love for computer science, cars, DIY projects.

As an electronics enthusiast, I enjoy using various programming languages such as Python and C++. 

I enjoy discussing the latest design and technology trends about cars but also historic cars.

The act of constructing and repairing things is something I find very satisfying. Having worked on various electronic gadgets, I have managed to repair some of the most common ones, including smartphones and PCs.
